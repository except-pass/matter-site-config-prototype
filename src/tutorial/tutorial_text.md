# **📘 Chart Tutorial**

## **1. Adding Points to a Chart**

![placeholder: add-points](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

You can add data points to any chart in two ways:

* **Click anywhere inside an empty chart area**
  This opens the point selector immediately.

* **Use the “Add Points” menu** in the top-right corner of the chart.

You can add as many points as you need—measurements or status values from any device at the site.

---

## **2. Resizing a Chart**

![placeholder: resize-chart](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

To change the size of a chart:

* Grab the **handle on the right edge** to make it wider.
* Grab the **handle on the bottom edge** to make it taller.
* Drag both to resize the chart in both directions.

Resize charts to give more room to important points.

---

## **3. Creating Additional Charts**

![placeholder: create-chart](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

Click the **“+” button** below any chart to create a new one.

Each chart can have:

* its own set of points
* its own size
* its own layout

Use multiple charts to compare different devices or mix measurements and status views.

---

## **4. Removing a Chart**

![placeholder: remove-chart](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

To delete a chart, click the **“X”** in the upper-right corner of the chart frame.

Removing a chart does **not** delete any data points—you can always create a new chart and add them again.

---

## **5. Managing Multiple Charts**

![placeholder: multiple-charts](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

You can scroll through, resize, and customize each chart independently.
This makes it easy to:

* Compare equipment
* Focus on critical metrics
* Split readings from different devices
* Create separate areas for measurements and status views

## **6. Browsing and Finding Data Points**

![placeholder: point-selector](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

Use the **Add Points** panel to find the data you want:

* Scroll through the list
* Search by name
* Use filters to narrow results by **component**, **type of data**, **unit**, or **feature**

Filters update automatically as you choose them.

If you need more advanced or technical points, increase the **Detail Level** slider.

---

## **7. Selecting Devices for Each Point**

![placeholder: device-selection](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

Many sites have multiple units of the same equipment (e.g., several inverters).
For each point you select, choose whether it applies to:

* **One device**
* **A selected group of devices**
* **All devices of that type**

You can add the same point for different devices in any combination.

---

## **8. Troubleshooting Point Discovery**

![placeholder: troubleshooting](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

If you don’t see the point you expect:

* Broaden your filters
* Adjust the **Detail Level**
* Search for part of the name
* Make sure the correct device type is selected

## **9. Understanding Line vs. Status Charts**

![placeholder: line-vs-status](ADD_IMAGE_HERE)

**Line charts**
Show measurements—numbers that rise and fall over time, such as:

* Power
* Voltage
* Current
* Temperature

These appear as a smooth line across the graph.

---

**Status charts**
Show what *state* the equipment was in over time, such as:

* Normal
* Failure
* On / Off
* Operating modes

Status points appear as colored bars instead of a line, showing when each state was active.
