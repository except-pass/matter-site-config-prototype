    description: TOU Discharge Stop SOC
    longdescription: Value from Site Configuration Battery/Battery Scheduling/Discharge Only. Sets the minimum state of charge (SOC) that the battery will discharge to during 'Discharge Only' operation. Once this level is reached, discharging stops to preserve reserve capacity for later use or backup.

Ensure the CTs are installed on the grid connection point and  not on the inverter's load side, so the inverter can correctly detect and prevent export.
