Perfect. I’ll walk you through the full setup from “local Vite React app on my laptop” → “public GitHub Pages site.”
You can follow this once and then redeploy with a single command.

I’ll assume:

* You already have a Vite + React app locally.
* You’re okay publishing it at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

If any of that isn’t true, you’ll still get a working answer because I’ll show both cases.

---

## 0. Name check (important for routing)

You need 2 values up front:

* `<username>` = your GitHub username
* `<repo-name>` = the repo you’re going to push to (ex: `myviteapp`)

We’ll use those everywhere.

---

## 1. Add `base` to `vite.config.js`

Why: GitHub Pages serves your site from `/<repo-name>/`, not `/`, so React asset URLs need that prefix.

Open `vite.config.js` (or `vite.config.ts`) and make it look like this:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/<repo-name>/', // <-- IMPORTANT: include your repo name with slashes
})
```

Example:

```js
base: '/myviteapp/',
```

If you skip this, you’ll get a blank page / 404s for assets on GitHub Pages.

---

## 2. Add deploy scripts to `package.json`

Install the deploy helper:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

Then edit your `package.json` and add these:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

Explanation:

* `npm run build` → creates `dist/`
* `npm run deploy` → pushes that `dist/` folder to a special branch called `gh-pages`
* GitHub Pages will serve that branch

You do **not** have to touch `dist/` manually.

Optional but nice: add a `"homepage"` field (not required for Vite, but good documentation for yourself):

```json
"homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/"
```

---

## 3. Initialize Git + push to GitHub

If you haven’t already:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

(You can create the empty `<repo-name>` repo on GitHub first in the browser and just paste that `git remote add` URL.)

---

## 4. First deploy to Pages

Now run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

What this does:

* Builds the site
* Creates/updates a `gh-pages` branch in that same GitHub repo
* Publishes static assets there

You’ll now have:

* `main` branch → your source code
* `gh-pages` branch → compiled production site

You don’t edit `gh-pages` by hand. You just redeploy.

---

## 5. Turn on GitHub Pages

In GitHub:

1. Go to your repo.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Scroll to **Pages** in the left sidebar.
4. Under “Build and deployment”:

   * **Source:** `Deploy from a branch`
   * **Branch:** pick `gh-pages` and `/ (root)`

Save.

After that, GitHub will build the public site.

Your app will live at:

```text
https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
```

It will be public.

(If you get a 404 immediately after, give GitHub a minute to publish, then refresh. After the first publish, future updates are basically instant because it’s just static content.)

---

## 6. Fix React Router (ONLY if you’re doing client routing)

If you’re using React Router (like `<BrowserRouter>` and custom routes such as `/dashboard`, `/settings`, etc.), GitHub Pages doesn’t natively know how to serve those deep links, so reloading `/dashboard` can 404.

You’ve got two decent options:

### Option A: Use `HashRouter`

In your React entry (usually `main.jsx` / `main.tsx`):

```jsx
import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
// ...
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <HashRouter>
    <App />
  </HashRouter>
)
```

This makes URLs look like `/#/dashboard` which GitHub Pages can handle without extra config. Easiest.

### Option B: Custom 404 redirect trick

If you really want pretty paths with `BrowserRouter`, create `404.html` inside `dist` during build. Easiest way:

* Add a file `public/404.html` in your project that does a JS redirect back to your app entry.
* Vite will copy it to `dist/` on build.

Example `public/404.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/<repo-name>/" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Replace `<repo-name>` with yours.

---

## 7. Redeploy flow going forward

After you make code changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "some change"
git push origin main
npm run deploy
```

That’s it. `npm run deploy` republishes the latest bundle.

---

## Bonus: one-time setup script (you can drop this in `setup-gh-pages.sh`)

This assumes:

* you already created the repo on GitHub
* you’re in the root of the Vite app
* you’ve replaced `<username>` and `<repo-name>`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

# 1. install gh-pages deploy helper
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# 2. ensure vite.config.js has base set (you still have to edit manually once)

# 3. commit code if not already
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit" || true
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git || true
git push -u origin main

# 4. build + publish to gh-pages branch
npm run build || true
npm run deploy
```

You still have to do the Settings → Pages step in the GitHub UI once so GitHub knows to serve `gh-pages`.

---

You do all that, you get:

* a public URL
* free hosting
* zero servers
* trivial redeploys

If you want, next I can show you what your `vite.config.js` and `package.json` should look like with your actual repo name filled in — just tell me your `<repo-name>`.
